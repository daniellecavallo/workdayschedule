# work-day-scheduler

## Description

This project takes template code from the repo below and adds in Javascript functions so that the page functions as a work day calendar app! You can save events on the page by typing into a time block and the time bocks are color-coded based on the current time. The project uses DayJS and also displays the current date. Enjoy!

## Tests

Keep in mind the current time as this app only has timeslots from 9am to 5pm! If outside 5pm, all slots should be grey. If between 9am-5pm, the app should highlight the current hour red and future hours green.
